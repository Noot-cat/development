# HTML Tutorial for Beginners

### **What is HTML?**

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the basic structure for websites.

### **Getting Started**

To begin coding in HTML, you only need a simple text editor and a web browser.

1.  **Text Editor:** You can use any text editor such as Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on Mac).
2.  **Web Browser:** This can be Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or any other browser you prefer.

### **Basic HTML Document Structure**

Every HTML document has a basic structure that includes the following elements:

*   `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document as an HTML5 document.
*   `<html>`: This is the root element of an HTML page.
*   `<head>`: This contains meta-information about the HTML page, such as the title.
*   `<title>`: This specifies a title for the HTML page, which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
*   `<body>`: This contains the visible page content.

Here is an example of a basic HTML page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

To see this code in action, copy and paste it into a text editor, save the file with a ".html" extension (e.g., "index.html"), and then open it in your web browser.

### **Common HTML Elements**

Here are some of the most common HTML elements you will use:

*   **Headings**: HTML has six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. `<h1>` is the most important heading, and `<h6>` is the least important.
*   **Paragraphs**: The `<p>` element is used to create paragraphs of text.
*   **Links**: The `<a>` (or anchor) element is used to create links to other web pages. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
*   **Images**: The `<img>` element is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image, and the `alt` attribute provides an alternate text for the image.
*   **Lists**: You can create unordered (bulleted) lists with `<ul>` and ordered (numbered) lists with `<ol>`. List items are defined with the `<li>` element.
*   **Tables**: The `<table>` element is used to create tables. Table rows are defined with `<tr>`, table headers with `<th>`, and table data/cells with `<td>`.

### **Advanced Concepts**

Once you have mastered the basics, you can explore more advanced HTML concepts such as:

*   **Forms**: Create interactive forms to collect user input.
*   **iFrames**: Embed another HTML document within the current page.
*   **Semantic HTML**: Use HTML elements to reinforce the meaning of information on web pages rather than just for presentation.

### **Learning Resources**
